# Optimizing-machine-learning-algorithm
Anomaly/Outlier detection is the process of finding abnormal data points in datasets or data streams. Anomaly detection finds its application in various fields like network intrusion detection, fraud detection, fault detection, etc. There are many anomaly detection algorithms available in the literature but most of these algorithms require setting of some parameters which significantly affect the performance of the algorithm. These parameters are generally set by hit-and-trial, hence performance is compromised with default or random values. In this project, we propose a optimizing algorithm for anomaly detection based on machine learning algorithms, algorithm for anomaly detection, though the approach used in the proposed solution is different. The algorithm is implemented on Python for scalability and thus the solution can handle big data as well and provides fast results. Experiments will going to be conducted on various datasets, and the results show that the proposed solution is much accurate than the standard algorithms of anomaly detection
